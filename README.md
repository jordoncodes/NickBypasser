# NickBypasser
A simple fabric mod designed for 1.20.2 to completely bypass nicknaming mods.
- Shows nicked players' real ign above their head
- requires the nick plugin to not hide player UUIDs
- Works by contacting Mojang's API
- Currently bad/messy code (could be optimised heaps)
- You can use it yourself if you build it.
