# NickBypasser
A simple fabric mod designed for 1.20.2 to completely bypass nicknaming mods.
- Shows nicked players' real ign above their head
- Download from releases section

## But how does it work?
- Uses the players UUIDs (if they aren't changed by the nicknaming plugin),
- Contacts Mojang's API to retrieve their ign and displays it above their head


F8 is the default keybind to toggle the mod from rendering the names.
